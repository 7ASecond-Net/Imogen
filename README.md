# Imogen
Imogen is the next generation digital forensic tool in combating child sexual exploitation, both online and off.

Imagine a world where child predators are truly scared to show their faces in the street, where children are safe again to walk alone.

This is more than possible with today's technologies and your help. Join the team and become a founder of the next generation of policing.

Todo:
There is a lot of duplication that currently needs refactoring if anyone is interested.
VLC video player integration is required.
Globalization is required.
